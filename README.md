# Home Assistant p1nrgy add-on repository

p1nrgy is a Home Assistant add-on that reads energy consumption data from DSMR-compatible smart meters and publishes the data to an MQTT broker. It's aim is to be blazing fast and lightweight, ideal for running on resource-constrained devices like Raspberry Pi.

p1nrgy is written in Go, so it compiles to a single binary and not using an interpreter, making it very/more efficient in terms of CPU and memory usage.
The idea is also to keep it as simple as it gets, reader the DSMR data, parsing it, and publishing it to MQTT. It's then up to the user in Home Assistant to consume the MQTT data.
